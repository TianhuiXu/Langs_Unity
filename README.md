# Langs_Unity

Langs' initial prototype implemented in Unity (See the Renpy version [here](https://github.com/TianhuiXu/Langs_Prototype_Renpy))

Langs is a language-learning game app, users interact with NPCs and complete tasks in different real-life scenarios to learn practical sayings which would allow them to thrive when they arrive in the destination country. Learning principles like spaced repetition & far transfer are also incorporated to boost your learning experience.

If you are an English speaker who are learning Mandarin and would like to practice listening & speaking through games in real-life scenarios. This app is for you!

This app hasn't been deployed yet. But you can try the web version first -
